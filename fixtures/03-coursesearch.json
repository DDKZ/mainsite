Ballet bifurcated into social dance and as a professional dance genre. This bifurcation of ballet begins the history of concert dance as a professional art form in the modern world. These changing meanings influenced the way each of these dance genres developed.\n\nDuring the twentieth century new forms such as modern and postmodern dance, butoh, styles of professional folk dancing that first developed in Eastern Europe, and classical Asian traditions that had never been presented outside of the courts in which they had developed. In addition, the nineteenth century saw the beginnings of Broadway musicals, and the twentieth century the development of dance for the movies, and later television, which dramatically increased the audiences and demand for dance performances. The course will look at the ways these various professional dance genres have developed, and the role they play in the concert scene today.\n"}}, {"pk": 764, "model": "coursesearch.course", "fields": {"code": "DANC151  PO-01", "name": "African Aesthetics", "grading_style": "Letter Grade", "number": 151, "spots": 20, "requirement_areas": [8], "note": "", "credit": 0.5, "code_slug": "DANC151-PO-01", "fee": false, "departments": [30], "instructor": "Gadlin, Kimberly A.", "cx_code": "2013;FA;DANC151  PO;01;UG13;UNDG;", "primary_department": 30, "filled": 17, "description": "Exploration of Cultural Styles: African Aesthetics.

Karate?s Objectives: Karate-do is founded on a tradition which seeks to fulfill three primary objectives apart from self-defense. First is the promotion of good health and vitality. This is achieved by improving one?s aerobic fitness, coordination, strength, flexibility, and reflexes. Second, a higher level of understanding of the art, both physically, and intellectually, which includes the study of culture, traditions, and philosophy . Third, karate strives to cultivate and nurture a healthy attitude among its practitioners, shaping one?s character by realizing the value of such traits as benevolence, courtesy, respect, humility, and recognizing the worth of all human beings. The student who perseveres will develop courage, self-control, and self-discipline. If these three objectives are kept in view and looked to for guidance, karate becomes a learning process and an extremely valuable link in a person?s general pattern of growth, development, and change throughout life, as well as an excellent means of prolonging that life by keeping physically fit.
